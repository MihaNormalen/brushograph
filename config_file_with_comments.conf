#In the "trays" section, you set coordinates for your containers. X & Y numbers represent the center of the container. 
#Containers are named C, M, Y, K and additionals (you can add more containers), since you can separate .jpg into CMYK+any other hex you want. 
#Pogram 12gc.py will prioritize additional colors and add CMYK only if needed.
